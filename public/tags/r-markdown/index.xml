      <description>Review of Properties of Estimators Preface Sufficiency is an important property of an estimator in statistics, which indicates that an estimator contains all the relevant information about the population parameter being estimated. Unbiasedness, efficiency, and consistency are related to sufficiency in the sense that these properties help evaluate the quality of an estimator. A sufficient estimator that is unbiased, efficient, and consistent would be considered an ideal estimator, as it would provide accurate estimates, achieve the smallest possible variance, and improve in accuracy as the sample size increases, all while using the most relevant information available in the sample data.</description>
